<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

All the code was developed for learning purposes and is from [Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript – 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&lis) by freeCodeCamp.org and Patrick Collins

The project represents a fully decentralized Web3 NFT Marketplace with TheGraph - [NFT Marketplace smart contract](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x3cb4F7C5f7e3355BEe1341251A8D8a2B04fBC7B7#code) 

Inside the web, users can sell/list their NFTs, buy the ones that they want and also withdraw the money of the sales they made

TheGraph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. It allows us to store the data of the events emited by the Smart Contract in a decentralized way (unlike Moralis)
